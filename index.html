                    <p>Hello! I am Christina - I fill my life with music, science, art, coding, food, and
                        things that make me happy (like fuzzy slippers and hot cocoa ❤️).<br>These blogs are a representation
                        of my life and the journey I am on. I am currently preparing for a big trip to South 
                        Korea to experience the culture and food in person. I will post into the Korea Blog as 
                        I live there for a short time and explore their beautiful country.<br>The dev blog is 
                        where I am keeping a log of my experiences with coding and future plans. I started to 
                        learn code with the intention of future employment. I have enjoyed learning to code and 
                        I know there is so much more to learn!<br>The personal blog is for me and perhaps I would 
                        allow a close friend or family member to read this blog, if they are brave enough. I am 
                        on a journey of healing and I have never been succesful at keeping a diary. With this blog
                         - I can vent and make personal reflections and whatever else I need to write about.<br>
                         <br>I hope you enjoy reading about my adventures! I have enjoyed writing about them. 😄
